  <p>My name is <em><span style="color:brown;font-weight:bold">SANDRA MARYANNE</span></em> I am 20years old.I completed my 
    form four last year but one and am the <bold>CEO<bold>of <bold><span style="color:brown;">ANISAN</span></bold><br> 
    I love nature and as a result of tht,
    i decided to come up with an idea to help control human wildlife conflict.

   <h2><bold><span style="color:brown;">MY BACKGROUND</span></bold></h2>
   <p>I was born and brought up in an area where by we face a challenge with the <em><span style="color: brown;">ELEPHANTS.</span></em>
    The pictures below show the examples of the human wildlife conflict:<br>

    <img src="https://bit.ly/32GzVfu" height="500px" width="500px">
    <br>As a result of that i came up with a gadget that will help control human wildlife conflict that:<br>
    <em><ul>
      <li>Detects early enough the presence of the Elephants</li>
      <li>Alerts the community earlier</li>
      <li>Scares away the Elephants</li>
    </ul></em>
    <bold><h2><span style="color:brown">MY HOBBIES</span></h2></bold>
    <p>When am at my leisure time i enjoy passing my time doing different activities such as:<br>
     <em><ol>
        <li>Swimming</li>
        <li>Dancing</li>
        <li>Reading Novels</li>
        <li>Listening to music</li>
     </em></ol>
     <bold><h2><span style="color:brown"> CURRENT INTERESTS</span></h2></bold>
     <p>Currently am at <strong><span style="color:brown">MORINGA SCHOOL</span></strong> pursuing my course so that i may be able to run my project by myself<br>
     Its so hectic and tiresome to keep following people to code for you your idea<br> My main wish is to pursue this course successfully
     and understand the full content too.</p>
