    <bold><h2>MY BACKGROUND</h2></bold>
    <p>I was born and brought up in an area where by we face a challenge with the <em>ELEPHANTS</em> as a result of that
    i came up with a gadget that will help control human wildlife conflict. It:
      <ol>
        <li>Detects early enough the presence of the Elephants</li>
        <li>Alerts the community earlier</li>
        <li>Scares away the Elephants</li>
      </ol>
      <bold><h2>HOBBIES</h2></bold>

        <bold><h2>MY CURRENT INTERESTS</h2></bold>

           and understand the full content too.</p>
